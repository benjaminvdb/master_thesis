	\frametitle{Traces Through Time (1) -- Context}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The National Archives stores millions of documents.
		\item Many documents have been converted to a digital format. \begin{itemize}
				\item Automatic: Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
				\item Manual: transcribed by hand.
				\end{itemize} 
		\item Connecting pieces of information regarding people is mostly done manually.
		\item Automating this process allows for studying people in all layers of society, not just the aristocracy.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Develop a methodology to identify and trace individuals across large and diverse historical datasets.
		\item Look particularly at `fuzzy' data \begin{customlist}{3.5em}{0em}
			\item Aliases: Will, William

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Traces Through Time (3) -- Collaboration}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The project set out as a collaboration between several institutes: \begin{itemize}
			\item The National Archives
			\item Institute of Historical Research
			\item Brighton University
			\item Leiden University
			\end{itemize}
		\item Brighton University worked on \emph{Natural Language Processing}.
		\item Our job was to perform record linkage on the extracted references delivered by Brighton University.
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Problem Definition (1)}
	
	\begin{block}{Record}
		A record $r$ is a tuple of $m$ attributes, each having a certain domain, that describes an entity, i.e., $r \in A_1 \times A2 \times \dots \times A_m$.
	\end{block}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	  	\item We assume that records are \alert{descriptions} of people.
	  	\item Records are potentially \alert{ambiguous}: they can describe more than one person.
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Problem Definition (2)}
	
	\begin{block}{Record Linkage}
		Given a set $\mathcal{R}$ of records, determine which of these records refer to the same entity.
	\end{block}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Record linkage is a \alert{binary classification problem}.
		\item Record pairs are classified as \alert{matching} or \alert{non-matching}.
		\item The set of entities is usually unknown.
		\item Even with expert knowledge, it is hard to determine the match status of a record pair.
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Record Extraction}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Instead of waiting for input from Brighton University, a simple context-free grammar was written in order to extract occurences.
  		\item First names and articles (of, de la, etc.) were used as anchor points in the text.
  		\item Capitalization, punctuation and ordering define the class of surrounding words.
  	\end{itemize}
  	
  	\begin{center}
  		\parsevar{first name} \parsevar{article} \parsevar{capitalized word} \\
  		$\downarrow$ \\ 
  		\parsevar{first name} \parsevar{article} \parsevar{last name}
  	\end{center}
\end{frame}

		Concerning the corn of \underline{Roger of Hyde}. Order to the \underline{sheriff of Oxfordshire} to make the king’s advantage without delay, by the view of law-worthy men, from all of the corn of \underline{Roger of Hyde, knight}, in Hyde, who is with the Earl Marshal, and to put in gage etc. all those who he will find threshing that corn and intermeddling with the land of the same \underline{Roger} without warrant, to be before the king at his command to answer for it.

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Record Field Comparison (1)}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Records are compared on a per-field basis.
		\item Fields can be of many different types, but we assume strings.
		\item Many different ways of computing distances between strings exist.
		\item To give an impression we will have a look at one particular approach.
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Record Field Comparison (2) -- $Q$-gram similarity}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A $q$-gram is a sequence of $q$ characters.
		\item To compute the $q$-grams of a word, move a sliding window over the word.\begin{itemize}
				\item \framebox{Joh}n
				\item J\framebox{ohn}
			\end{itemize}
		\item String similarity between words defined as the similarity between their respective multisets of $q$-grams.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\pause
	
	\begin{equation*}
		\textrm{sim}_{\textrm{jaccard}}(\sigma_1, \sigma_2) = \frac{c_{\textrm{common}}}{c_1 + c_2 - c_{\textrm{common}}}
	\end{equation*}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Record Field Comparison (3)}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Many different string similarity functions exist. \begin{itemize}
			\item Edit distance: uses number of transformation steps.
			\item Soundex: phonetic similarity.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Similarity values can often be converted to distances, e.g., $\mathrm{dist}(\sigma)=1-\mathrm{sim}(\sigma)$.
		\item Distance function chosen depending on the content.
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Candidate Pair Classification (1) -- Distances}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A distance function is defined for every field.
		\item The classifier first uses these functions to map a record pair to an array of distance values.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\vspace{-8mm}
	
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathrm{map}_{\mathrm{dist}}(\bm{r}_1, \bm{r}_2) \to (d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n)	 \qquad \text{with } \left\vert \bm{r_1} \right\vert = \left\vert \bm{r_2} \right\vert = n
	\end{equation*}
	
	\pause
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Distance values are thresholded to obtain a binary value: fields are either \alert{equivalent} or \alert{nonequivalent}.
		\item If one or both values are missing, the fields are considered equivalent.
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Candidate Pair Classification (2) -- Probabilities}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If a record field pair is equivalent, we look up the \alert{prior probability} of a person having that property, e.g., in a census.
		\item If such information is unavailable, we can compute the prior probability from the data.
		\item Equivalent, but are not unequal values, are treated as an \alert{equivalence class} and their probabilities are summed.
		\item Using the data itself introduces a bias towards `famous people', i.e., people that occur often.
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Candidate Pair Classification (4) -- Confidence}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The last step of classification is to aggregate the probabilities in a confidence score.
		\item Record pairs with nonequivalent fields are not considered for linking.
		\item Assume independence of fields, e.g., \textit{First Name = John} does not affect the probability of \textit{Last Name = Williams}.
		\item The confidence score is computed as the sum of log probabilities:
	\end{itemize}
	
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathrm{conf}(\bm{p})=\sum_{i=0}^{\left\vert \bm{p} \right\vert}\log{p_i}
	\end{equation*}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Contextual Information (1)}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The previously described procedure makes use of information that is relatively easy to obtain.
		\item Fields are often empty and the confidence score is therefore low.
		\item We may be able to exploit the fact that references occur within a certain \alert{context}.
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Contextual Information (3) -- Observations}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Many stop words occur that are probably not informative.
		\item There are a few interesting words: Customs, Fish, Salt.
		\item Individual words might be indicative of the \alert{topic} discussed.
		\item We need of means of extracting these words from the data.
		\item We propose \emph{Maximally k-Informative Itemsets} for this.

		\item Per definition, Mikis consist of items that are uncorrelated.
		\item Roughly stated: items that occur frequently together are captured in the Miki by only one of the items.

		\item For each item in the Miki, we introduce a binary feature to the records, using the probability of each in the `lookup step` of the classifier.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item For validation of the system, we used manually annotated data from The Gascon Rolls project.
		\item The Gascon Rolls are records that were drawn up by the English royal administration of Aquitaine-Gascony (south-western France) between 1273 and 1468.
		\item Contain grants of land, oaths of treaties and other important documents.
		\item The dataset consists of so-called \emph{calendars}, which are summaries of the actual rolls.
		\item The original text was written in Latin and translated to modern English.
