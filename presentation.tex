\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Traces Through Time (1) -- Context}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The National Archives stores millions of documents.
		\item Many documents have been converted to a digital format. \begin{itemize}
				\item Automatic: Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
				\item Manual: transcribed by hand.
				\end{itemize} 
		\item Connecting pieces of information regarding people is mostly done manually.
		\item Automating this process allows for studying people in all layers of society, not just the aristocracy.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Develop a methodology to identify and trace individuals across large and diverse historical datasets.
		\item Look particularly at `fuzzy' data \begin{customlist}{3.5em}{0em}
			\item Aliases: Will, William
			\item Incomplete data: John (only a name)
			\item Spelling variations: Owen, Eoghan
			\item (OCR) Errors: Wihiam (William)

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Traces Through Time (3) -- Collaboration}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The project set out as a collaboration between several institutes: \begin{itemize}
			\item The National Archives
			\item Institute of Historical Research
			\item Brighton University
			\item Leiden University
			\end{itemize}
		\item Brighton University worked on \emph{Natural Language Processing}.
		\item Our job was to perform record linkage on the extracted references delivered by Brighton University.
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Problem Definition (1)}
	
	\begin{block}{Record}
		A record $r$ is a tuple of $m$ attributes, each having a certain domain, that describes an entity, i.e., $r \in A_1 \times A2 \times \dots \times A_m$.
	\end{block}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	  	\item We assume that records are \alert{descriptions} of people.
	  	\item Records are potentially \alert{ambiguous}: they can describe more than one person.
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Problem Definition (2)}
	
	\begin{block}{Record Linkage}
		Given a set $\mathcal{R}$ of records, determine which of these records refer to the same entity.
	\end{block}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Record linkage is a \alert{binary classification problem}.
		\item Record pairs are classified as \alert{matching} or \alert{non-matching}.
		\item The set of entities is usually unknown.
		\item Even with expert knowledge, it is hard to determine the match status of a record pair.
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Record Extraction}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Instead of waiting for input from Brighton University, a simple context-free grammar was written in order to extract occurences.
  		\item First names and articles (of, de la, etc.) were used as anchor points in the text.
  		\item Capitalization, punctuation and ordering define the class of surrounding words.
  	\end{itemize}
  	
  	\begin{center}
  		\parsevar{first name} \parsevar{article} \parsevar{capitalized word} \\
  		$\downarrow$ \\

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Record Field Comparison (1)}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Records are compared on a \alert{per-field basis}.
		\item Fields can be of many different types, but we assume \alert{strings}.
		\item Many different ways of computing distances between strings exist.
		\item To give an impression we will have a look at one particular approach.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item A $q$-gram is a sequence of $q$ characters.
		\item To compute the $q$-grams of a word, move a sliding window over the word.\begin{itemize}
				\item \framebox{Joh}n
				\item J\framebox{ohn}
			\end{itemize}
		\item String similarity between words defined as the similarity between their respective multisets of $q$-grams.\footnotemark

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Record Field Comparison (3)}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Many different string similarity functions exist. \begin{itemize}
			\item Edit distance\footnotemark: uses number of transformation steps.
			\item Soundex\footnotemark: phonetic similarity.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Similarity values can often be converted to distances, e.g., $\mathrm{dist}(\sigma)=1-\mathrm{sim}(\sigma)$.
		\item Distance function chosen depending on the content.

	\footcitetext{Soundex}
	
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Candidate Pair Classification (1) -- Distances}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A distance function is defined for every field.
		\item The classifier first uses these functions to map a record pair to an array of distance values.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\vspace{-8mm}
	
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathrm{map}_{\mathrm{dist}}(\bm{r}_1, \bm{r}_2) \to (d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n)	 \qquad \text{with } \left\vert \bm{r_1} \right\vert = \left\vert \bm{r_2} \right\vert = n
	\end{equation*}
	
	\pause
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Distance values are thresholded to obtain a binary value: fields are either \alert{equivalent} or \alert{nonequivalent}.
		\item If one or both values are missing, the fields are considered equivalent.
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Candidate Pair Classification (2) -- Probabilities}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If a record field pair is equivalent, we look up the \alert{prior probability} of a person having that property, e.g., in a census.
		\item If such information is unavailable, we can compute the prior probability from the data.
		\item Equivalent, but are not unequal values, are treated as an \alert{equivalence class} and their probabilities are summed.
		\item Using the data itself introduces a bias towards `famous people', i.e., people that occur often.
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Candidate Pair Classification (4) -- Confidence}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The last step of classification is to aggregate the probabilities in a \alert{confidence score}.
		\item Record pairs with nonequivalent fields are not considered for linking.
		\item Assume \alert{independence} of fields, e.g., \textit{First Name = John} does not affect the probability of \textit{Last Name = Williams}.
		\item The confidence score is computed as the sum of log probabilities:
	\end{itemize}
	
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathrm{conf}(\bm{p})=\sum_{i=0}^{\left\vert \bm{p} \right\vert}\log{p_i}
	\end{equation*}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Contextual Information (1)}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The previously described procedure makes use of information that is relatively easy to obtain.
		\item Fields are often empty and the confidence score is therefore low.
		\item We may be able to exploit the fact that references occur within a certain \alert{context}.
	\end{itemize}

		\item Per definition, Mikis consist of items that are \alert{uncorrelated}.
		\item Roughly stated: items that occur frequently together are captured in the Miki by only one of the items.
		\item This makes the items within a Miki a good candidate for modelling `topics' of text segments.
		\item For each item in the Miki, we introduce a binary feature to the records, using the probability of each in the `lookup step` of the classifier.

	    The general \emph{F-measure} measures the effectiveness of retrieval with respect to a user who attaches $\beta$ times as much importance to recall as precision in the following way:\footnotemark
	    \begin{equation*}
	        F_{\beta} = (1 + \beta^{2}) \cdot \frac{2 E_{p} E_{r}}{(\beta \cdot E_{p}) + E_{r}}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Details are not important: the F-measure is a means of combining precision and recall in one measure.

\begin{frame}{Conclusions (1) -- Occurrences}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item The grammar proved to do a reasonable job at extracting occurrences.
		\item Writing the grammar is a lot of work and dataset specific.
		\item Occurrence extraction was not the main focus of this project and should be done with more sophisticated methods.
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Conclusions (2) -- Mikis}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Mikis have not shown to have a significant impact on the performance of the record linker.
		\item There can be many reasons for this. \begin{enumerate}
 				\item Topic modelling does not give the kind of textual information we want.
 				\item Mikis are unable to model topics appropriately.
 				\item The usage of Mikis was incorrectly handled in the confidence score computation.
 			\end{enumerate}
 		\item More work is needed to be conclusive.

\begin{frame}{Conclusions (3) -- Record Linkage}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item The linker was able to retrieve about $30\%$ of the truly positive pairs with reasonable precision.
		\item The remaining part was hard to distinguish from the negative pairs, based on the confidence score.
		\item Candidate pairs are now compared in isolation.
		\item It might be worthwhile to research methods that consider pairs in a relational setting.
